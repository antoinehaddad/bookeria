THE BRIEF :

We would like you to develop a small application for managing a library. It will allow to 
create / update / delete some authors and some books. The application will come with 3 pages :

a form for creating / updating an author
a form for creating / updating a book
a homepage that will display authors and books
An author is made of 3 properties : first name, last name and nationality
A book is made of 6 properties :  title, author, cover picture, ISBN, creation date, tags. Tags will be created on the fly in the book form type.

Security : the homepage will be public, but the forms will be accessible by registered users only. 
A console command will allow to list authors and books.

Finally, we will expose a mini REST API with only one http endpoint : a GET method for retrieving all books before or after a given creation date and / or from authors with a given nationality. Response body will be formated in JSON.

Requirements :

The application will be built with Symfony 4.0 or later. It will not use any third party library/bundle, but only Symfony built-in components.

Security : there will be a User entity implementing the Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface. Authentication itself can be a simple http basic authentication. No need to create a full login form. Each User will also have an 'apiKey' property that will allow them to access the http endpoint for retrieving books.

Authors, Books and User entities will be managed with Doctrine ORM.

When creating an author, we will check that no author with same first name / last name allready exists.

Outcome of the test :

Source Code (.zip)
A brief "Read Me" should be provided in order to install the application and to test the endpoint from a Postman client (for example).
If you have access to a web server to deploy your application, a demo URL could also be provided
